# Exercise-3

In the space below, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly. See `complete` branch for an example.

### **The 'git push origin master' Command**

When using the 'git push origin master' command:

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
```

- It uploads the work you have done on the repo code to Github or the master branch of development.
- We use this after we have committed to a change.
- Once we refresh the Github page, our changes to the repo can be seen
